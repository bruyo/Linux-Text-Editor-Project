# Linux-Text-Editor-Project

## Project Review
Linux text editors are essential tools for developers, system administrators, and general users. They provide functionality for coding, scripting, and configuration file management. The study categorizes editors into terminal-based such as Vi, Vim, Nano etc. and GUI-based types (These editors provide graphical interfaces, making them suitable for users who prefer a visual experience such gedit, kate, Vscode etc), providing insights into their adoption based on user preferences and industry demands.
